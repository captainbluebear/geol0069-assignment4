# Unsupervised Learning with Altimetry Classification on SEN-3 Data

## About The Project

This project was created to demonstrate the following objectives: 
1. Classification of sea ice and leads using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with altimetry data from Sentinel-3.
2. Graphs of the classified echoes for visual analysis.
3. A confusion matrix comparing our GMM-classified results with the official ESA classification.

For more detailed explanations on each of these steps, as well as the code, refer to the contents of `Unsupervised_Learning_Methods_Assignment4.ipynb`.
## Getting Started
The notebook runs linearly, with steps depending on their predecessors. Very few modifications have to be made on your end, aside from mounting your drive to the notebook and modifying the file paths so that the SAR
