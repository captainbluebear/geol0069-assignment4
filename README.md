# Unsupervised Learning with Altimetry Classification -- Assignment 4

In this notebook are the following:
1. Classification of sea ice and leads using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with altimetry data from Sentinel-3.
2. Graphs of the classified echoes to analyse them.
3. A confusion matrix comparing our GMM-classified results with the official ESA classification.

Now, let's explore the application of these unsupervised methods to altimetry classification tasks, focusing specifically on distinguishing between sea ice and leads in Sentinel-3 altimetry dataset.
